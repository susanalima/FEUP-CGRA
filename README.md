# FEUP-CGRA
Project developed for Computer Graphics class.

Made in colaboration with [Afonso Azevedo](https://github.com/4-Z3r0)

## Final Project

The project consists of the modeling of a functional vehicle, a crane and a terrain, as well as an interface that allows controlling certain elements (such as the maximum speed of the vehicle and its texture). 

The vehicle is controlled using the keyboard (w,s to frontal and back movement, and a and d to control the direction).
